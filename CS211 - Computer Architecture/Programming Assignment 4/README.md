# Defusing a Binary Bomb
Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (CS:APP, 3rd ed.)</br>
Rutgers University - New Brunswick</br>
2021 Spring</br></br>

## Learning Goals
You will learn about how all programs written in programming languages like C are compiled down to assembly instructions that run as machine code on hardware. You will learn to reverse engineer what short snippets of assembly code are doing. You will gain familiarity with the Linux environment and debugging tools such as gdb and objdump.</br></br>

## Resources
Get started early! You can post questions to the class Piazza (please avoid sending emails to the TAs and instructor).

* You can discuss the assignment with your classmates, but you cannot copy code from your classmates.
* You can use the internet to research the mechanics of the C programming language, data types, and algorithms, but you cannot use websites that offer ready-made answers specific to this assignment and this class. Consider citing any sources that you use in your research; such a citation can be as simple as providing a link to a webpage in a code comment.
* We will be checking the assignments for identical and/or plagiarized code using automated tools.
